{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1b85ad","input":"While the code still runs 5 times, the output has changed. It now includes 5!

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"20b7ef","input":"In this section, we will talk about for loops and while loops. In general, for loops are better for running a block of code a set number of times and while loops are better for running a block of code until some condition changes or is met. We'll start off by looking at for loops.","pos":20,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6d96be","input":"This input is always read as text, or as a string. If we want to use user input in an equation, we would need to convert the string to an integer, or an int. For the default example 13 was entered, then 12.","pos":7,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ade99e","input":"Next, we'll take a look at while loops.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ae5b83","input":"In the block below, we will make a while loop that runs 5 times ( mimicking \"for i in range(5)\" ). For while loops, they have the potential to run infinetly. While we may want this, it can also freeze our program.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c0ba47","input":"To generate a random integer between two specified numbers, all we need to do is use the \"randint\" function as seen below.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"db6bfe","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
