{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3aa654","input":"In this section, we will talk about for loops and while loops. In general, for loops are better for running a block of code a set number of times and while loops are better for running a block of code until some condition changes or is met. We'll start off by looking at for loops.","pos":20,"type":"cell"}

Next we need to pick a random number between 1 and the user selected number.\n\n","pos":41,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6f6126","input":"Next, we'll take a look at while loops. In general, you can make a while loop do anything that a for loop can do but with slightly different syntax, so if you find youself understanding while loops better than for loops, you can just focus on using them. ","pos":27,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"782913","input":"In the block below, we will make a while loop that runs 5 times ( mimicking \"for i in range(5)\" ).

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"884a79","input":"Python uses the \"random\" module to generate (functionally) random numbers as well as performing a variety of chance based tasks.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dc1240","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e6ef46","input":"We can see that the variable \"i\" is increased each time the loop is run. Then, once \"i\" stops being less than 5, the code stops running.
